        George Kusunoki Miller (born 18 September 1992), better known by his stage name Joji and formerly by his
        online aliases Filthy Frank and Pink Guy, is a Japanese singer, songwriter, rapper,
        record producer, author, and former Internet personality and comedian.

        Miller's start as an entertainer began on his now defunct YouTube channels, DizastaMusic, TooDamnFilthy,
        and TVFilthyFrank, that consisted of rap songs, rants, extreme challenges, ukulele performances and a
        shock humor show titled The Filthy Frank Show, with most of the main characters played by Miller, including
        the titular character of Filthy Frank. To complement his TVFilthyFrank channel, Miller produced comedy
        hip hop music under his Pink Guy alias, who is also a zentai-wearing recurring character on The Filthy Frank
        Show,
        with his songs featured on the show and his discography spanning two full-length projects and an extended play.
        Miller's videos had widespread impact, including starting a viral dance craze known as the Harlem Shake,
        which was directly responsible for the debut of Baauer's "Harlem Shake" song atop the Billboard Hot 100.
        Many YouTube personalities have made major or cameo appearances on The Filthy Frank Show, including
        h3h3Productions, iDubbbz, JonTron, Michael Stevens, and PewDiePie.

        In December 2017, Miller stated he had retired the channel to focus on his music career, under the name Joji,
        producing more nuanced and serious music, releasing the EP In Tongues, which peaked at number 58 on the
        Billboard 200, and his debut studio album Ballads 1, which reached number 1 on Billboard's top R&B and hip-hop
        chart in November 2018. With this, Miller became the first Asian-born artist to do so. Miller's music has
        been described as a mix between R&B, lo-fi and trip hop.
